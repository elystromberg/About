  I'm a PhD candidate at the department of Sociology at the University of Amsterdam, and the 
  Interuniversity Center for Social Science Theory and Methodology (ICS) in the Netherlands.

  My PhD project is placed in the Horizon Europe funded project EQUALSTRENGTH which investigates
  cumulative and structural forms of discrimination, outgroup prejudice and hate crimes against
  ethnic, racial and religious minorities. More information about EQUALSTRENGTH can be found 
  [here](https://equalstrength.eu/about.html).
  
  I am also working on improving robustness of educational mobility research, my master's thesis
  can be found [here](https://su.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1709900). A working 
  paper titled "How Robust are Country Rankings in Educational Mobility?" I'm writing together
  with Per Engzell (UCL) will be available shortly.

  Previously I have worked as a research assistant in a project on the role of recrutiment for
  gender differences in Swedish universities, led by Anna Sandberg and Eva Ranehill. You can read
  more about that project [here](https://www.gu.se/en/news/the-role-of-recruitment-for-gender-differences-within-the-academy).
